Release Scripts
========================================

The install scripts are desiged for LANL CTS-1, ATS-2 and Cray platforms.  They are also provided
for LLNL ATS-2 and LANL's Darwin machine.

Assumptions:

1. Directory layout:
   /usr/projects/draco/draco-NN_NN_NN/
                 scripts/release.sh       # the main release script
                 logs/                    # build/test logs
                 source                   # git checkout of release branch
                 flavor/opt|debug|rwdi    # released libraries/headers
2. Assumes that this script lives at the location above when executed.

Usage:

1. Setup release directory:
   newgrp ccsrad
   umask 027
   cd /usr/projects/draco
   mkdir draco-NN_NN_NN[-rcNN]
   cd draco-NN_NN_NN[-rcNN]
   mkdir logs
   git clone git@github.com:lanl/Draco.git source
   (cd source; git checkout -b draco-NN_NN_NN origin/draco-NN_NN_NN)
2. Update machinefamily settings and configuration option in scripts/<family>-env.sh.
3. Update Draco specific settings in draco-cmake-options.sh
4. Update scripts/*-env.sh scripts to setup modulefiles and configure modes.
5. Build and test the release (run this from the front-end -- except for darwin)
   scripts/release.sh &> logs/release-snow.log &
6. Monitor progress as log files are created in the logs directory.


Usage (Darwin):
--------------------
Same as above, except you must already have an allocation and be logged onto the back end before
running the release script.

1. power9

salloc -N 1 -p power9-asc -A asc-priority
cd /usr/projects/draco/draco-7_5_0
source/tools/release.sh &> logs/release-darwin-power9.log &

2. x64 + Volta

salloc -N 1 -p volta-x86 -C cpu_family:haswell

3. ARM

salloc -N 1 -p arm


Usage (ATS-2)
--------------------
Same as above but run the script from within an allocation.
lalloc 1 -W 240
cd /usr/gapps/jayenne/draco-7_8_0
source/tools/release.sh | tee logs/release-rzansel.log
