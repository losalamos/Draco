The XEmacs elisp files associated with this package make up a development enviornment used by
CCS-2. To use these files add the elisp directory to your Emacs load path and then load the
draco-setup package..

Follow the example provided by sample.emacs in your own $HOME/.emacs add the following elisp.  You
should replace the path to the Draco environment (~/draco/environment) directory with the real path
on your current machine.  The value shown below assumes that you have Draco checked out in your home
space.  The directories should be listed in the order you want them searched for Draco elisp code.

;; Load Draco Elisp files

(setq my-draco-env-dir "~/draco/environment/" )
(load-library (concat my-draco-env-dir "/elisp/draco-setup"))

It is recommended that you compile the .el files located at draco/environment/elisp for better emacs
performance.  Simply run 'make' from the draco/environment/elisp directory.  If you have a lot of
elisp commands in your ~/.emacs.d directory, you may want to compile those files too.

There are several packages that are recommended for instalation via Melpa (M-x package-list-packages):
- cmake-mode
- fill-column-indicator
- highlight-doxygen
- lua-mode
- rtags
- yaml-mode

MELPA - Install extra Emacs modes
==============================
Copy the MELPA setup code into ~/.emacs and restart emacs.
Try installing yaml-mode and cmake-mode:
M-x package-list-packages
C-s cmake-mode ==> click to install
C-s yaml-mode  ==> click to install
q              ==> quit

Useful Keybindings
==============================

* Get a list of current keybindings by issuing the command "C-h b".

C-x C-f  Open new file or directory.  For example I type C-x C-f cap
         [tab] [enter] to open a directory listing of my capsaicin
         directory.

C-x 5 f  Open new file in a new frame.
C-x 2    Split the current frame into two buffers.
C-x 1    Force the current buffer to occupy the entire frame
         (unsplit).
C-x 0    Remove the current buffer from being displayed in the current
         frame.

f1       Compile.  The compile command can be modified in the command
         window before execution.  You can middle-click on compile
         errors to visit the source.

M-x shell Open a command window running $SHELL.
C-h k <key sequence> Provides a description of the XEmacs command
         bound to <key sequence>

C-mouse1 Popup a buffer menu.
C-mouse2 Popup a mode menu.

M-g      goto line
C-M-g    what line

f7       save and kill buffer
C-f7     kill buffer
S-f7     delete this window

C-S-f8   find companion file (.cc <-> .hh)
f8       previous buffer

f5       Insert function documentation block
S-C-f5   Insert class documentation block
C-Sh-f5  add-change-log-entry
f6       Insert comment divider

f9       SVN examine
